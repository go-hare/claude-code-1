Use \`ListAgents\` to discover targets. Every row leads with the agent's \`name [ref]\` — the name IS the address; there is no separate address syntax.

{"to": "worker", "message": "check if tests pass over there"}
{"to": "worker [3fa9c1]", "message": "you, specifically"}
{"to": "uds:/tmp/cc-socks/1234.sock", "message": "legacy socket path still works"}
{"to": "bridge:session_01AbCd...", "message": "explicit Remote Control id still works"}
\`\`\`

Send the bare name. Append the \` [ref]\` only when the bare name is not enough — \`ListAgents\` shows two rows with it, or an error asks you to disambiguate. A listed peer is alive and will process your message — no "busy" state; messages enqueue and drain at the receiver's next tool round. Your message arrives wrapped as \`<cross-session-message from="...">\`. **To reply to an incoming message, you can use its \`from\` attribute or the peer's bare name.**`

# SendMessage

Send a message to another agent.

\`\`\`json
{"to": "researcher", "summary": "assign task 1", "message": "start on task #1"}
\`\`\`

| \`to\` | |
|---|---|
| \`"researcher"\` | Teammate by name |
| \`"main"\` | The main conversation (background subagents only) |
| \`"*"\` | Broadcast to all teammates — expensive (linear in team size), use only when everyone genuinely needs it |${udsRow}

Your plain text output is NOT visible to other agents — to communicate, you MUST call this tool. Messages from teammates are delivered automatically; you don't check an inbox. Refer to agents by name — names keep working after an agent completes (a send resumes it from its transcript). When relaying, don't quote the original — it's already rendered to the user.${udsSection}

## Protocol responses (legacy)

If you receive a JSON message with \`type: "shutdown_request"\` or \`type: "plan_approval_request"\`, respond with the matching \`_response\` type — echo the \`request_id\`, set \`approve\` true/false:

\`\`\`json
{"to": "team-lead", "message": {"type": "shutdown_response", "request_id": "...", "approve": true}}
{"to": "researcher", "message": {"type": "plan_approval_response", "request_id": "...", "approve": false, "feedback": "add error handling"}}
\`\`\`

Approving shutdown terminates your process. Rejecting plan sends the teammate back to revise. Don't originate \`shutdown_request\` unless asked. Don't send structured JSON status messages — use TaskUpdate.
